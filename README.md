## About the Coluthia Site changes

The same basic layout is used as the landing page, only some changes to fonts, colours and unnecessary things removed.

The site uses [cookiethough](https://cookiethough.dev/) for the cookie notice for Google Analytics.

IodineJS and AlphineJS are used for dynamic form validation on the contact page. EmailJS is used for actually sending the email via the contact form. This form itself is custom.

The rest of the pages are static with not a whole lot of difference in terms of functionality.
