        <h3 class="text-3xl my-6">Information automatically collected</h3>

        <p class="mb-8 lg:text-2xl"><strong>In Short:</strong> Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP)
          address and/or browser and device characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our Services.

          operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how
          and when you use our Services, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to
          maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-8 lg:text-2xl">Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar
          technologies.</p>

        <p class="mb-8 lg:text-2xl">The information we collect includes:</p>

        <ul class="list-disc list-outside lg:text-2xl ml-8">

            performance information our servers automatically collect when you access or use our Services and which we
            record in log files. Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address,
            device information, browser type, and settings and information about your activity in the Services (such as
            the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches, and other actions you

            numbers, location, browser type, hardware model, Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating
            system, and system configuration information.</li>
          <li class="mb-4"><em>Location Data.</em> We collect location data such as information about your device's
            location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and
            settings of the device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to
            collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of
            allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your
            Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain
            aspects of the Services.</li>

        <p class="mb-8 lg:text-2xl"><strong>In Short:</strong> If you choose to register or log in to our services using
          a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.</p>

        <p class="mb-8 lg:text-2xl">Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party
          social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will
          receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we
          receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email
          address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a
          social media platform.</p>

        <p class="mb-8 lg:text-2xl">We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in

          purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law
          (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your
          personal information for longer than six months. </p>

        <p class="mb-8 lg:text-2xl">When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
          information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example,
          because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your
          personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

        <h3 class="text-3xl my-6">8. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h3>

        <p class="mb-8 lg:text-2xl"><strong>In Short:</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to

          By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a
          minor and consent to such minor dependent's use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from
          users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable
          measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected
          from children under age 18, please contact us. See the last section on HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS
          NOTICE? to do so.</p>

          time.</p>

        <p class="mb-8 lg:text-2xl">If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing
          your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory

        <p class="mb-8 lg:text-2xl">However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing

        <p class="mb-8 lg:text-2xl">Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your
          account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to
          prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply
          with applicable legal requirements.</p>

        <h3 class="text-3xl my-6">10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>

        <p class="mb-8 lg:text-2xl">Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include
          a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
          about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard
          for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT
          browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.
          If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
          practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>

          are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to
          ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For
          instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that
          we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you
          through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use
          other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.</p>
        <p class="mb-8 lg:text-2xl">We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your
          identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional
          information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the
          information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes
          of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally
          provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.</p>
