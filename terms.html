            To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim
            related to these Terms of Use (each "Dispute" and collectively, the “Disputes”)
            brought by either you or us (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), the 
            Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes
            expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating
            arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.            
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-2xl my-6"><em>Binding Arbitration</em></h4>
          <p class="mb-8 lg:text-2xl">
            Any dispute arising from the relationships between the Parties to this contract shall be determined by one arbitrator who will be chosen in accordance with the Arbitration
            and Internal Rules of the European Court of Arbitration being part of the European
            Centre of Arbitration having its seat in Strasbourg, and which are in force at the time the application for arbitration is filed, and of which adoption of this clause constitutes
            acceptance. The seat of arbitration shall be Dundalk, Ireland. The language of the proceedings shall be English. Applicable rules of substantive law shall be the law of Ireland.

          <p class="mb-8 lg:text-2xl">
            The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law,
           (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; (c) and there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported
            representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.

            invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to
            arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction
            within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
